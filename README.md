# Support for a reading list of the "Translation from Latin" undergraduate course

In our course, students have to read four texts:

* Terence's Adelphoe
* Seneca's Letters to Lucilius, Book 1
* Horace's Odes, Book 1
* Tibullus' Elegies, Book 1

The XQueries and documents in this repository help us produce exercises and exams for the course.
